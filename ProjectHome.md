# Welcome to the Kneemail Desktop Project #

Kneemail is a prayer, praise and general journal software. Its design is based on the organization of an email application. So, Kneemail Desktop is as easy to use as any email software available today.

Kneemail Desktop is powered by the Mozilla Platform just as [Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.com) are. This means one can create extensions to enhance the base functionality of Kneemail Desktop. However, for now, there is not any active development for extensions. This will be added at a later date.
